# Morse-Code-Translator
A simple International Morse Code translator that I developed for ICS 212.

This is a simple International Morse Code translator that I developed in C. The program takes in morse code input from the user using '.', '-', and '/' as dots, dashes, and space respectively. Each line of morse code is separated by a space to denote that the next character will be created. When the program is ran with a given input from the user, a single line of the translated code will be presented in English in the CLI.

Here is an example of translating the phrase "hello world" from morse code to CLI:

```
user:~$ ./program .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
user:~$ hello world
```
